## Best Practices Summary

1. **Start Early**: Implement testing from day one
2. **Test Pyramid**: Focus on unit tests, fewer E2E tests
3. **Automate Everything**: Automate repetitive testing tasks
4. **Continuous Testing**: Integrate testing into CI/CD
5. **Risk-Based Testing**: Focus on critical areas first
6. **Team Collaboration**: Involve everyone in quality
7. **Regular Review**: Continuously improve testing process
8. **Documentation**: Keep testing documentation updated
9. **Training**: Invest in team testing skills
10. **Metrics**: Measure and track testing effectiveness
